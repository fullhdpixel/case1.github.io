    Conclusion
  </Typography>
  <Typography paragraph>
    In this policy brief, we have enquired into the behavioural impediments to the siting of wind farms in the Netherlands. In doing so, we have made use of a literature study to assess whether and why people oppose the siting of wind farms near their residential areas, and we have used a questionnaire to assess the effects of different compensation schemes to alleviate these behavioural impediments. Our most important conclusion is that compensation schemes are an interesting method of increasing public support in some specific cases, but are definitely not a panacea to frictionless wind farm siting. An important additional consideration is to assess the beliefs about visual and auditory annoyances held by local residents, and correct them whenever possible, so as to increase public support. Finally, it is possible to improve the technological implementation of wind farm siting in such a fashion as to actually reduce some of these annoyances at the root cause, and in doing so remove the associated behavioural impediments to some extent.

    We would like to invite all readers of this policy brief to consider the aforementioned
    recommendations to see whether they might help in further achieving the ongoing transition towards a fully renewable electricity generating infrastructure in the Netherlands. We are open to any exchange of opinions based on this policy brief at the website of the Wetenschappelijk Bureau GroenLinks, think tank of the Dutch Green Party, and look forward to any opportunity to further clarify our recommendations wherever possible.
