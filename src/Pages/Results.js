      Next, we present an overview of the results of our experimental survey. In order to best analyse our data, we have excluded all respondents that failed to correctly identify the compensation scheme they had been offered in the manipulation check. If the respondents would not be able to recall which compensation scheme they were offered, it would likely also not have influenced their degree of public support. As such, the final sample that was employed was reduced from 758 to 482 respondents.

    <Typography paragraph className='pl-3 pr-3'>
      We used tests of differences among means to analyse the differences in public support and perceived fairness between various groups. Group-wise means and significance values are summarised in the background document. We briefly discuss our key findings below.

    <Typography paragraph className='pl-3 pr-3'>
      Among those who received the house owners scenario, the co-ownership of wind energy scheme receivedproject received marginally more support than other compensations. It was also perceived as the fairest compensation scheme. Notably, the average public support for participatory budgeting was lower than even when receiving no financial compensation at all. However, we concede that these differences for various compensation schemes among homeowners were not statistically significant.
